# Machine Learning Lectures

This repository contains an updated version of my lectures and workshops given at:
  - The CERN Computing School in [Mol 2016](https://indico.cern.ch/event/502875/) and in [Madrid 2017](https://indico.cern.ch/event/581756/)
  - The [GRIDKA School in Karlsruhe 2017](https://indico.scc.kit.edu/indico/event/285/)
  - The [KSETA Topical Courses in Karlsruhe 2017](http://www.kseta.kit.edu/690.php)
  - The [Machine learning workshop in Paris 2018](http://www2.iap.fr/users/charnock/conferences/ML2018)

The talks are javascript and html-based using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). They can be viewed online via github pages:
  - On [Traditional Machine Learning](https://thomaskeck.github.io/talks/MachineLearning.html)
  - On [Deep Learning](https://thomaskeck.github.io/talks/DeepLearning.html)
  - On [Machine Learning at KIT and Belle II](https://thomaskeck.github.io/talks/PhDThesis.html)

The workshops are provided as [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), which can be served as [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentations.
